This project involves data analysis on the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Using R, I explored customer data to understand patterns and factors influencing subscription to term deposits. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data visualization, and building predictive models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. Performance evaluation was done using metrics like confusion matrices, ROC curves, and AUC scores. The goal is to extract meaningful insights that can help improve future marketing strategies. All code and findings are documented in this repository.
